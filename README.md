Writing about static site generator dataset

Users:

 - people from different backgrounds adopt different tools
 - front-end (FE) engineers would also care less about main theme for SSG, but would fork
 - non-frontend people are a big user group, ready-made themes are important for them, they don't fork

Theme popularity:

- top Hugo themes  even+learn+coder+academic each have 1-1.1k github stars, while @GoHugoIO
  itself is 49k stars
- Jekyll (41k) -> Mimimal Mistakes (7k) 
- mkdocs (11k) ->  mkdocs-material by @squidfunk (5.2k)
- themes not transferable between SSGs due to semantics

Total universe:

- Next.js and Wordpress popular for site-building, but htey are server-side, not exactly SSG
- many CMS

Open questions:

1. Do 'created' vs 'modified' repo dates ring any bell? (Hint: depreciations, project life, stars/day rate)
2. Imagine you knew the total user base per programming language, how would you use it?
3. If you had a theme list per SSG, what would you do?
4. Note `open_issues` field - how would you use it?

Limitations:

- one snapshot of data, not time series
- Github stars are not usage, just a proxy
